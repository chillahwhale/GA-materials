# Hackathon

Pick a Kaggle competition from the following list. You have the choice of completing a regression problem, a classification problem, or an NLP problem involving either classification or sentiment analysis.

## Options
### Regression

- [Walmart Store Sales Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting)
- [Box Office Revenue Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction)
- [New York City Taxi Fare Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction)

### Classification
- [Predicting a Biological Response](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bioresponse/data)
- [Kobe Bryant Shot Selection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kobe-bryant-shot-selection)
- [Shelter Animal Outcomes](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes)
- [Airbnb New User Bookings](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings)

### NLP
- [Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews)
- [What's Cooking?](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking)
- [Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/)

## Timeline
- **9:00am** - Project introduction & team assignment
- **10:00am** - Slack Noelle what competition/dataset you've chosen (only one partner needs to do this). Make sure both partners are satisfied with the choice.
- **4:30pm** - We will do lightning talks where you'll walk the rest of the class through your problem solving process and what you completed. No slides necessary; you can walk us through your Jupyter notebook if you prefer.
- **5:00pm** - Submit a link to your project repository on Google classroom (only one partner needs to do this). You are also encouraged to submit your predictions to Kaggle as well (you can make a late submission if the competition is closed) and see how you did!
- **6:00pm** - Complete the reflection form on Google Classroom (BOTH partners need to do this).

## Guidelines

We know this is a short time for a project. We're not expecting anything as polished as project two or three, for example. However, the goal is for you to have something to show for your time. At a minimum, do some EDA and have at least two models fit and scored.

## Rubric

*Scores will be out of 21 points based on the 7 categories in the rubric.** <br>
*3 points per section*<br>

| Score | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| **0** | *Project fails to meet the minimum requirements for this item.* |
| **1** | *Project meets the minimum requirements for this item, but falls significantly short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |
| **2** | *Project exceeds the minimum requirements for this item, but falls short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |
| **3** | *Project meets or exceeds portfolio-ready expectations; demonstrates a thorough understanding of every outlined consideration.* |

**Data Cleaning and EDA**
- Are missing values imputed/handled appropriately?
- Are distributions examined and described?
- Are outliers identified and addressed?
- Are appropriate summary statistics provided?
- Are steps taken during data cleaning and EDA framed appropriately?

**Visualizations**
- Are sufficient visualizations provided?
- Do plots accurately demonstrate valid relationships?
- Are plots labeled properly?
- Are plots interpreted appropriately?
- Are plots formatted and scaled appropriately for inclusion in a notebook-based technical report?

**Preprocessing and Modeling**
- Are categorical variables appropriately handled?
- Does the student properly split and/or sample the data for validation/training purposes?
- Does the student utilize feature selection to remove noisy or multi-collinear features?
- Does the student test and evaluate a variety of models to identify a production algorithm?
- Does the student defend their choice of production model relevant to the data at hand and the problem?
- Does the student explain how the model works and evaluate its performance successes/downfalls?

**Evaluation and Conceptual Understanding**
- Does the student accurately identify and explain the baseline score?
- Does the student select and use metrics relevant to the problem objective?
- Does the student interpret the results of their model for purposes of inference?
- Is domain knowledge demonstrated when interpreting results?

**Project Organization**
- Are modules imported correctly (using appropriate aliases)?
- Does the README provide a good executive summary of the project?
- Is markdown formatting used appropriately to structure notebooks?
- Are there an appropriate amount of comments to support the code?
- Are files & directories organized correctly?
- Are there unnecessary files included?
- Do files and directories have well-structured, appropriate, consistent names?

**Python Syntax and Control Flow**
- Is care taken to write human readable code?
- Is the code syntactically correct (no runtime errors)?
- Does the code generate desired results (logically correct)?
- Does the code follows general best practices and style guidelines?
- Are Pandas and sklearn functions used appropriately?

**Teamwork**  
- How is the student's self-rating for teamwork?
- How is the student's rating for teamwork from their partner?
- How is the student's self-rating for data science skills?
- How is the student's rating for data science skills from their partner?
- Did the student put in effort throughout the project?
- Was the work evenly distributed?

## Note

Do not duplicate someone else's analysis and make sure to give credit to any resources you used. :)

## Have fun!
