''' Write a function that asks a user to guess the value of a random number.
If they guess a number that is too low, tell them so, and prompt them to try again.
If they guess a number that is too high, tell them so, and prompt them to try again.
If they guess a number they have already guessed, tell them so, and prompt them to try again.
If they guess correctly, tell them so, and also tell them how many tries it took.

There are no doctests for this challenge.
