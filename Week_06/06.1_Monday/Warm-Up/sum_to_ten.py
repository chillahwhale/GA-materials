'''
Write a function called pairs_of_ten() that takes a list of integers as an argument.
Return a list of unique integer pairs that sum to 10, represented as tuples, from the input list.
Assume that pairs following this example are unique: (7, 3) and (3, 7).

>>> pairs_of_ten([5, 6, 6, 5, 7, 4, 3, 4]) == {(6, 4), (5, 5), (7, 3)}
True
