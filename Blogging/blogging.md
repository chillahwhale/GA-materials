## Why Blog?

There's three reasons.

- Great way to increase exposure
- Proving by showing
- It's Fun!

### Intro

As a first and foremost (and, sure, copout example): Google is your friend. Posts of "How to do X" yield tremendous codealong examples. This is where you'll find well-established collections.

- [Analytis Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com) is where I often find great codealong examples, like this one of [tree-modeling from scratch](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/04/complete-tutorial-tree-based-modeling-scratch-in-python/).
- [Chris Albon's website](https://chrisalbon.com/#articles) Is my go to for pandas topics.

### Data Journalism

My favorite data journalism blog is [FiveThirtyEight](fivethirtyeight.com). They do smart visualizations, data collection, engaging writing in politics, economics, health, and lifestyle. Here are a few of my favorite FiveThirtyEight classic: [Swing State Interactive](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/15/us/politics/swing-history.html?_r=0), [Voting Elasticity](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/swing-voters-and-elastic-states/), [Messi is impossible](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lionel-messi-is-impossible/).

### Data Science Blogging

My favorite data science personal blog, and one we should all seek to emulate, is [Max Woolf's](http://minimaxir.com/). Let's check out what he does well in the following:

- [Stack Overflow](https://minimaxir.com/2018/02/stack-overflow-questions/)
- [Vizualizing Clickbait](https://minimaxir.com/2015/01/linkbait/)

We'll break up into groups to read the articles and come together to discuss what we think Max does well.

Note that your audience is equally significant in the choice of your blog. If your blog has a high number of code snippets, it will be immediately less (or un) approachable for non-technical audiences. Because of this, I like the way Max provides __both__ a Jupyter Notebook and written write-up for his blogs.

### Examples

- From some GA Instructors:
  - Blog posts can also be more technical, like this [explanation of PCA](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-one-stop-shop-for-principal-component-analysis-5582fb7e0a9c)...
  - Or more [gif-heavy, like this explanation of p-values](https://towardsdatascience.com/people-are-talking-about-reproducibility-crises-and-p-values-and-i-feel-like-i-should-28b5d5fbe70a)
  - Or more visual [What Real Fake News Says About Obama's Presidency](https://hackernoon.com/what-real-fake-news-says-about-obamas-presidency-4bf42be71ff1)

- From some former DSI Denver students:
  - An overview of [Data Science](https://medium.com/@scottrosengrants/what-is-data-science-how-not-to-be-the-chandler-bing-of-all-your-friends-402abd3b8d64)
  - A more technical explanation of [solving a coding challenge](https://medium.com/@magnus.bigelow/computational-complexity-and-calculating-pi-dc5ed82467b6)
  - A personal story involving [EDA with data from a race that this student ran](https://medium.com/@mybiyani/plodder-i-have-pr-to-beat-now-f9b19bc995e3)


Note: You can use whichever publishing platform of your choice (e.g. [Medium](https://medium.com/)) or if you are feeling ambitious, [here](https://blomadam.github.io/tutorials/2017/04/09/ipynb-to-Jekyll-Post-tools.html) are some instructions for how to convert your Jupyter Notebooks into markdown files suitable for a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog (will be hosted by GitHub @ your_username.github.io). For completion purposes, we just need it to be publicly accessible so we can check your progress throughout the course.
