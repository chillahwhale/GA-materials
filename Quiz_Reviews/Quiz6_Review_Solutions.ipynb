    "\n",
    "Quiz 6 will be like a “technical interview” quiz - expect about 20% to be on neural networks and everything else to be from the rest of the cohort. Please note: this is not an exhaustive list by any means, but it will serve as a starting point for interview prep as well as help you prepare you for quiz 6. The other way that you could prepare is by reviewing questions from previous quizzes and the bank of interview questions located [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/outcomes-tech-interview-prep).\n",

The elbow is the point at which we begin to see diminishing returns in explained variance when increasing k. The true answer is usually driven by the application, though.
