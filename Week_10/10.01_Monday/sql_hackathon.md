# SQL Hackathon ðŸŽ‰
_Author: Jeff Hale (DSI - DC)_

## Goal

Perform data analysis on Kiva Loans. See what insights you can find as you develop your SQL muscles! ðŸ’ª

This dataset is a random subset of rows and selected column from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding#kiva_loans.csv). The original dataset is publicly available under a [CC0: Public Domain license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

## Roles

- One person from your group will be the spokesperson who will present your results.
- Another person is the moderator who will keep the group on task and make sure everything is humming along and everyone is on board with decisions and understands what's happening.
- The third person will share their screen and keep the official queries file for the group (everyone should work on their own queries, too).

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have PgAdmin4 and PostgreSQL installed.

2. In PgAdmin4, create the database, schema, and tables. In the left side bar, right click on _Databases_ and click _Create->Database_ and enter _kiva_ for the name and click the _Save_ button. Then enter [the code below](#code-to-create-schema-and-tables) in the query editor and run it.

3. After you have created the four tables, insert the data into the tables.

- Click on one of the tables in the side bar.
- Select _import/export_
- Toggle the _export_ button to _import_.
- Click the three dots and navigate to your cloned repo with the data files.
- Select the matching .csv file.
- Toggle the _header_ button on.
- Click _import_.

Repeat the import process for the other three tables.

4. Use queries to explore the data. You are doing analysis in this hackathon, you aren't predicting anything. See what interesting insights you can find. ðŸ˜€

While putting the data into Python or Tableau would allow for cool visualizations, that's not our focus today. See what insights you can learn using SQL only. There is a data dictionary [here](./data_dictionary.md).

5. Lightening presentations.
    After 1.5 hours, or some other time specified by your instructor, we'll reconvene and your group will do a 5 minute walk-through of your analysis. Assume the audience here is your classmates and instructors, to keep it simple.

## Have fun and good luck! ðŸš€


## Code to create schema and tables

-- Create database, schema, and tables

```

CREATE SCHEMA kiva
    AUTHORIZATION postgres;

CREATE TABLE kiva.financials
(
    "id" integer NOT NULL,
    "funded_amount" text,
    "currency" text,
    "term_in_months" float,
    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
)
WITH (
    OIDS = FALSE
);

ALTER TABLE kiva.financials
    OWNER to postgres;

CREATE TABLE kiva.use
(
    "id" integer NOT NULL,
    "activity" text,
    "sector" text,
    "use" text,
    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
)
WITH (
    OIDS = FALSE
);

ALTER TABLE kiva.use
    OWNER to postgres;


CREATE TABLE kiva.demographics
(
    "id" integer NOT NULL,
    "country" text,
    "region" text,
    "borrower_genders" text,

    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
)
WITH (
    OIDS = FALSE
);


ALTER TABLE kiva.demographics
    OWNER to postgres;


CREATE TABLE kiva.crowdsource
(
    "id" integer NOT NULL,
    "posted_time" text,
    "funded_time" text,
    "lender_count" integer,

    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
)
WITH (
    OIDS = FALSE
);

ALTER TABLE kiva.crowdsource
    OWNER to postgres;
```
