Positive integers have so many gorgeous features. Some of them could be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive positive numbers.

Consider some examples:
    - 10, could be expressed as a sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
    - 9, could be expressed as a sum of (2 + 3 + 4) or (4 + 5)
    - 42, could be expressed as a sum of 9 + 10 + 11 + 12

Task
Given Positive integer, N, Return true if it could be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive positive numbers, otherwise return false .

>>> consecutive_ducks(9)
True

>>> consecutive_ducks(64)
False

>>> consecutive_ducks(42)
True
